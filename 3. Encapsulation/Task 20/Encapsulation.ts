/*
 * Task 20:
 * What are benefits of encapsulation in object oriented programming?
 *
 * Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the
 * data (methods) together as a single unit.
 * In encapsulation the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes and can
 * be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
 * We should declare the variables of a class as private to achieve encapsulation and provide
 * public setter and getter methods to modify and view the values the variables values.
 *
 * The benefits of Encapsulation:
 *      The fields of a class can be made read-only or write-only.
 *      A class can have total control over what is stored in its fields.
 *      Hiding unnecessary information of the object.
 *      Allowing you to change the structure inside class without affecting the other classes
