/*
 * Task 30:
 * Does TypeScript support multiple inheritance? No.
 *
 * Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent class.
 *
 * The problem with multiple inheritance:
 *
 * Assuming that you have 3 classes A, B and C where A and B share the same method which is show() method,
 * class C inherits characteristics of the above two methods. So whether class A or B was the show() method
 * in class C inherited from?
